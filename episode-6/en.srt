Amazing!

49
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:39,320
With this mi-ra-cu-lous potion, Coriander defies death itself!

50
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,060
Yes-yes-yes...

51
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,310
The potion of Zobification... what a nonsense!

52
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,930
It's time to rate MY potion.

53
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,430
The real potion you've all been waiting for...

54
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,040
...Potion of Poshness!

55
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,310

Incredible!

57
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,470
This potion could make all of Komona rich!

58
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,180
It seems, Coriander has already been eliminated!

59
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,470
Interestingly, Is Shichimi able to beat the last demostration?

60
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,300
I... I didn't know we had to give a demonstration.

61
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,970
Come on Shichimi!

62
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,390
Everyone's waiting for you!

63
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,770

65
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,390
It is so dangerous!..

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,560
S-sorry!..

67
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,350
Ladies and gentlemen...

68
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,100
...It seems that Shichimi forfeits...

69
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,020
Give me that!

70
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,970

71
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:47,710

Wait,  I think I have an idea!

81
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,560

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,850
Understood?!
