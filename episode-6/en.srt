I must've fallen asleep with the window open again...

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Oh... It's so windy...

7
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,310
...and why can I see Komona through the window?

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,140

You even thought to bring a potion, my clothes, and my hat!

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,270

[shouting] Well! First up Coriander's demonstration:/

45
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,100
Ladies & gentlemen...

46
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,640

47
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,970
...Potion of Zombification!

48
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,060
Amazing!

49
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:39,320
With this mi-ra-cu-lous potion, Coriander defies death itself!

50
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,060
Yes-yes-yes...

51
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,310
A potion of Zombification... that's nice.

52
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,930
But it's time to rate MY potion.

53
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,430
The real potion you've all been waiting for...

54
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,040
...The Potion of Poshness!

55
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,310
Fantastic!

56
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,350
Incredible!

57
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,470
This potion could make all of Komona rich!

58
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,180
Your applause means Coriander has been eliminated!

59
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,470
Will Shichimi be able to beat the last demonstration?

60
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,300
I... I did not know we had to give a demonstration.

61
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,970
Come on Shichimi!

62
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,390
Everyone's waiting for you!

63
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,770
No!..

64
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,720
I cannot!..

65
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,390
It is so dangerous!..

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,560
S-sorry!..

67
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,350
Ladies and gentlemen...

68
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,100
...It seems that Shichimi forfeits...

69
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,020
Give me that!

70
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,970
CAREFUL!!!

71
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:47,710
[1-st version] What could be so dangerous? You're just scared that your potion isn't so fantastic as mine!
[2-nd version] No matter what you potion does, everyone already knows that I've won the contest!

72
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,220

73
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,720
...GIANT MONSTERS!!!

74
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,100
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor!

75
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,850

76
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,080
[Version 1:] What are you doing? RUN! [Version 2:] Run, Idiot!

77
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,100

78
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,110
[sarcastically] You're lucky, Carrot; It seem nobody will see you Wondrous potion...

79
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,680
[background shout:]  Help!.. Anybody!.. She will ruin our town!!! Stop her!

80
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,640
Wait,  I think I have an idea!

81
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,560
Hey!

82
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,020
You over-sized-posh-zombie-canary!

83
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,970
Wanna try one last "potion"?

84
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,310
But first...

85
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,600
... read the label!

86
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,810
Read it carefully!

87
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,910
If you don't get out of Komona right away, trust me I'll pour it all over you!

88
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,850
Understood?!

89
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,340
Because she saved our town, we award first place to...

90
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,640
...Pepper!

91
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,100
For her marvelous potion!

92
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,930
Oh, stop it you...

93
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,890
...it's not so marvelous...

94
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,180
...it's just my cat's pee sample!

95
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,770
Isn't it, Carrot?

96
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,020
Meow!
