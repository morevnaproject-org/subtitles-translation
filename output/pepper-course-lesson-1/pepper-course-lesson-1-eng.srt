Hello friends!

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,500
On your screen, you can see a clip from the "Pepper & Carrot" motion comic.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,160
And in this video course, I'll teach you how to create such an animation.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,660
You can download files for this lesson

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,100
by following relevant links in description of this video.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,420
If you purchased the full course, then you can find them included in the archive.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,340
For the further work we need:

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,900
"GIMP"…

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,980
and "Blender" with the "COA Tools" add-on installed for both.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,480
Let's start with installing the COA Tools add-on in GIMP.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,920
Open the downloaded COA Tools folder.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,080
And copy the file located in the "GIMP" folder.

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:01:04,040
Then, go to the GIMP settings folder…

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,980
…and find the "Plugins" folder.

15
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:15,180
Paste the file we copied from COA Tools.

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:24,160
Make sure that the add-on is executable.

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,900
Done.

18
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:34,220
The COA Tools add-on allows GIMP to export every layer into separate pictures as a PNG.

19
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,600
The add-on also exports additional information about the placement of each layer.

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,160
Now, let's open our .ORA file in GIMP.

21
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,440
Here is the character you saw in beginning of this video.

22
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:57,060
Notice, it is separated into layers so that we can animate it.

23
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,780
For some parts you can see several versions exist.

24
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,160
For example, there are different variants of mouth here.

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:14,240
The grouping tells the export plug-in to trade these parts specially in the long to switch them during animation process.

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,360
For all other other cases however, the parts should not be grouped.

27
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,560
So, let's start exporting.

28
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,500
Click "File"…

29
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,360
…then "Export to CoaTools".

30
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:35,680
Next, enter the name and path of the scene.

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,820
Done.

32
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,560
Let's check the result.

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,440
As you can see, the add-on created a folder where we can find all our layers separated.

34
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,760
Also, there is a file with the .JSON extension.

35
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,140
This file stores information about coordinates of each layer.

36
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,420
We will need it to import our scene into Blender.

37
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,280
But first, we need to install COA Tools add-on for Blender.

38
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,720
Just like in the beginning, start by opening the downloaded COA Tools folder.

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,080
Open the "Blender" folder inside.

40
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,800
Here we can see another folder — "coa_tools".

41
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,900
We need to make a .ZIP archive of it.

42
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,120
Done.

43
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,900
Next, let's run Blender.

44
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,400
Go to "File" -> "User Preferences…"

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,740
And find the "Add-ons" tab.

46
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,560
Then click on the "Install from File…" button.

47
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Select the "coa_tools.zip" archive.

48
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,940
After that, find the installed add-on.

49
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:05,020
Put a tick before it and click "Save User Settings".

50
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,220
Done.

51
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,900
If you've done everything correct, then in T-menu…

52
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,440
(the one which is opened by 't' key)

53
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,800
…the "Cutout Animation" tab will appear.

54
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,120
Let's import our scene.

55
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,940
Delete the start scene…

56
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,980
Now, you need to snap your cursor to the center.

57
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:36,060
To do that, you need to press the key combination "Shift+S"…

58
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,680
…and choose "Cursor to Center".

59
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,840
Then, go to "Cutout animation" in T-menu.

60
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,120
And click on "Create new Sprite".

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,780
A plain axes object is created.

62
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,160
Our scene will be linked to it.

63
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,240
Now, press the "Import Sprites" button

64
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,940
and choose the .JSON file, which was created earlier.

65
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,560
Voilà! We've successfully imported our scene into Blender.

66
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,120
Everything is in its place!
