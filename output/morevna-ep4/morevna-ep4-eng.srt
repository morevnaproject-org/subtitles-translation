Morevna Project presents

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,820
Yes, I knew it...

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,860
I knew everything...

5
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,400
I came to destroy it...

6
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,180
But at that moment...

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,480
It became...

8
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,660
My only way...

9
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,920
The only source...

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,460
And I'd accepted it...

11
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,220
And I'd become it...

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,660
Epsiode 4: Death(less)

13
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,800
Oh, could it be...

14
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,580
Oh yeah, I'm absolutely not interested...

15
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,440
Who in the middle of the night in Marya Morevna's cellar  behind the iron lock...

16
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,600
Is trying to start up the fourth generation engine with hydraulic booster and air turbine.

17
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,320
After all, it could  be some kind of... lodgers?

18
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,600
We are vagrant auto mechanics and looking for a temporary housing

19
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,960
Oh, of course! I am happy to offer an excellent wet cellar for ya.

20
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,060
But why the hell it doesn't start?

21
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,580
So, let's get started!

22
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,860
But... where is the engine?

23
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,300
Thank you, Ivan Tsarevitch, you've helped me

24
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,820
Now you'll never see Marya Morevna again!

25
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,600
Oh, no...

26
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,600
What's going on here?

27
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,620
Where's everyone?

28
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,400
Dead...

29
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,060
Everyone is dead...

30
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,580
A giantlike evil robot came...

31
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,580
...and killed everybody

32
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,060
But Marya Morevna?

33
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,060
He kidnapped her...

34
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,860
We tried to stop him, but...

35
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,600
Good-Bye, young man...

36
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,040
And tell my family...

37
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,080
...I loved them all dearly

38
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,220
*Here! Step aside, step aside! Let's get him over here! Careful!*

39
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,670
*Get out of my way!*

40
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,660
*CLEAR!*

41
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,660
*GET THE OTHERS OUT OF HERE*

42
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,080
*Let stretcher-bearers through!*

43
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
*Quick, get him onto the stretcher!*

44
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,740
*STEP ASIDE!*

45
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,820
*CLEAR! One, two, lift!*

46
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,720
*Stay away!*

47
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,320
And tell my family...

48
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,600
*ONCE MORE! CLEAR! QUICKER!*

49
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,160
*Bring the ladder over here!*

50
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,600
I'll tell them...

51
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,160
I will definitely tell them...

52
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,640
And I'll save Marya Morevna as well!

53
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,780
Farewell!

54
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,720
Is it over?

55
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,680
No, no. I am just passing by

56
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,380
Where?
