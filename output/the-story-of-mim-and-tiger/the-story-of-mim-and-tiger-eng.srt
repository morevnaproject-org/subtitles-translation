The Story of Mim and Tiger

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,000
Once upon a time, there lived a Mim.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,440
He worked in a zoo.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,720
One day...

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,720
...right in the middle of his performance...

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,940
...the director of the zoo approached him and invited into his office.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,420
Calm down kid...

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,860
Listen...

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,960
Yesterday a monkey died in the zoo.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,920
She was everyone’s favorite...

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,700
Replace her. We’ll pay you well!

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,260
Mim accepted the deal.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,600
He had never had a job like that (or better).

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,100
He got delicious food, fame...

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,480
Above all — He did absolutely nothing.

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,460
In a week he noticed...

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,460
...interest to him had fallen down.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,380
Now the audience were interested in a tiger from the next cage.

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,080
That hurt Mim deeply.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,400
So then, he climbed to the tiger and started to tease him.

21
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,040
The tiger didn't like that, of course.

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,120
More and more people were coming to watch the show.

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,400
The zoo’s networth had grown up...

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,640
Mim got a pay rise.

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,440
Day after day he climbed to the tiger...

26
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,420
Tiger roared...

27
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,300
Audience applauded.

28
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,040
But one wonderful day…

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,860
Death, awful and imminent, was inexorably approaching him.

30
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,740
Mim screamed.

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,480
Tsch... Shut up!

32
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,800
Or you want us both to lose the job?
